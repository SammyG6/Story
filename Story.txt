One day, a boy named Charlie went to the local arcade to play games. He realized as soon as he got there someone had beaten his highschore on his favorite game. He knew he had to get his highscore back! Charlie went everyday after to school to the arcade to try and get his highschore back.  He was spending all his quarters trying to get back on top.  Night after night he kept going home without the highscore and without any quarters. In this way, he fail in all of his exam. He felt really bad about his test score, but it was nothing in comparison to his high score that he wanted to get. He just kept going back over and over again.
